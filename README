This plugin defines a global list of available completion functions so that you can switch completion functions fast.

If you write a plugin which provides completion functions be kind to your users and use this plugin to never override the choice of a user.

You can register your completion function to a global list optionally specifying a filetype scope such as "xml".

When you start completion using <c-x><c-o> you'll be asked which completion function should be used if there are more than one available. This <c-x><c-o> mapping will set 'omnicomplete' by default.
completefunc will be set to the next completefunc automatically (if it wasn't set by you).

If you jump to a different buffer your last choice will be remembered depending on filetype.

Of course setting a default function can still be annoying. Thus you can just set it in a ftplugin file this way:
CFComplete haxe#CompleteClassName

Of course there are mappings to cycle through completion functions as well
